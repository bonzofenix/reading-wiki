## Creating a syllabus

- see common principles and simpler building blocks.

- Choose the highest yield material

- find skill that allows me to practice the widest range of the material.

- ensure quick wins at the beginning by increasing margin of safety

- Identify the least amount of work required to get the desired result. Distil techniques to the fewest moving pieces.

Start by learning techniques that are less likely to fail.

Target areas which leverage existing skills. Find commonality with my current skills.


##  Putting it to practice

- Write one-page summary (cheat sheet) of key principles.

- Write practical one-page example for practice which encompass the principles.

- conquer fear with low stakes practice.

Â - Use simulation to practice without the need for elaborate setup.

- If possible convine what you are learning with something of high interest.

- If memorizing, it helps to have frequent breaks in the middle of the session.

Information hard to remember can often be encoded using mnemonics.

Once basic skill is internalized, shorthand instructions can be less stressful.




## Motivation

- Leverage the fear of loss and public humiliation by publicly bettinig on success.

- Focus on convenience to begin with. Creating the habit is more critical than perfect performance.

- It is possible to forecast setbacks and found this helps their effect on morale.

- Make it measurable and a competitive game.
