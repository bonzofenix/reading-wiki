Mutual fund investors are confident that they can easily select superior fund managers. They are wrong.

nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at a nominal annual rate of 6.2 percent; annual pretax profits of our nation’s corporations have grown at a rate of 6.3 percent. The correlation between the growth of GDP and the growth of corporate profits is 0.98. (1.0 is perfect.) I assume that this long-term relationship will prevail in the years ahead.

Warren Buffett puts the moral of his story this way: For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases. Accurate as that cryptic statement is, I would add that the parable reflects the profound conflict of interest between those who work in the investment business and those who invest in stocks and bonds. The way to wealth for those in the business is to persuade their clients, “Don’t just stand there. Do something.” But the way to wealth for their clients in the aggregate is to follow the opposite maxim: “Don’t do something. Just stand there.” For that is the only way to avoid playing the loser’s game of trying to beat the market. When a business is conducted in a way that directly defies the interests of its clients in the aggregate, it is only a matter of time until the clients

stock market returns into two parts: (1) investment return (enterprise), consisting of the initial dividend yield on stocks plus their subsequent earnings growth (together, they form the essence of what we call “intrinsic value”), and (2) speculative return, the impact of changing price/earnings multiples on stock prices. Let’s begin with investment returns.

The message is clear: In the long run, stock returns depend almost entirely on the reality of the investment returns earned by our corporations.

investors will expect and how they will act as each new bit of information finds its way into the marketplace.

The expectations market is about speculation. The real market is about investing. The stock market, then, is a giant distraction to the business of investing.

The true investor . . . will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.

The winning formula for success in investing is owning the entire stock market through an index fund, and then doing nothing. Just stay the course.

If a fund with $100 million of assets earns a time-weighted return of 30 percent on its net asset value during a given year, and investors, recognizing the strong

return, purchase $1 billion worth of its shares on the final day of the year, the average dollar-weighted return earned by its investors would be just 4.9 percent.

In that chapter, I described three sources of return on stocks: the initial dividend yield and the earnings growth (together, “investment return”), and changes in the P/E multiple (“speculative return”).

the humble arithmetic of fund investing: nominal market return, minus investment costs, minus an assumed inflation rate of 2 percent (slightly above the rate that the financial markets are now expecting over the coming decade) equals just 0.1 percent per year.

Is trend following a winner’s game or a loser’s game? Are ETFs truly low-cost vehicles after we add their brokerage commissions and taxes on short-term profits to their expense ratios? Is buy-and-sell (often with great frequency) really a better strategy than buy-and-hold?

you like the idea of sector ETFs, invest in the appropriate ones, and don’t trade them.

Today, the lion’s share of the assets of TIFs are those that track the broad U.S. stock market (the S&P 500 or the total stock market index), the broad international stock market, and the broad U.S. bond market.

ETFs, on the other hand, make no claim to prescience. Rather, most rely on one of these two strategies: (1) Offer broad market index funds that investors can profitably trade in real time. (This seems to be a specious claim.) (2) Create indexes for a wide range of narrow market sectors that investors can swap back and forth, earning extra profits. (In fact, the evidence goes the other way.)

One smart beta ETF portfolio, for example, is weighted by the dollar amount of dividends distributed by each corporation, rather than weighted by the market capitalizations of its components.

smart beta ETFs (renamed “strategic beta” by Morningstar) have ballooned—from $100 billion in 2006 to more than $750 billion currently. They have accounted for a remarkable 26 percent of mutual fund industry cash flows during the first four months of 2017.

That 94 percent figure suggests that long-term fund investors might profit by concentrating more on the allocation of their investments between stock funds and bond funds, and less on the question of which particular funds to hold. Benjamin

My recommendations for investors in the accumulation phase of their lives, working to build their wealth, focused on a stock/bond mix of 80/20 for younger investors and 70/30 for older investors. For investors starting the postretirement distribution phase, 60/40 for younger investors, 50/50 for older investors.

There are two fundamental factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio between stocks and bonds: (1) your ability to take risk and (2) your willingness to take risk.

together, your ability to accept risk and your willingness to accept risk constitute your risk tolerance.

First, and most important, you must make a strategic choice in allocating your assets between stocks and bonds.

Second, the decision to maintain either a fixed ratio or a ratio that varies with market returns cannot be sidestepped. The fixed ratio (periodically rebalancing to the original asset allocation) is a prudent choice that limits risk and may well be the better choice for most investors.

In general, investors should not engage in tactical allocation.

Fourth, and perhaps most important, is the decision as to whether to focus on actively managed mutual funds or traditional index funds. Clear and convincing evidence points to the index fund strategy.

there will be times when stock market prices rise above (or fall below) that intrinsic value. This may well be a time when some overvaluation exists. (Or not. We can never be sure.) But in the long run, market prices have always, finally, converged on intrinsic value.

your bond position should equal your age, with the remainder in stocks.

younger, have limited assets to invest, don’t need investment income, have a higher tolerance for risk, and believe that equities will provide higher returns than bonds over the long term, we should own more stocks than bonds.

As we age, we begin to rely less on the human capital that has largely got us to where we are today, and more on our investment capital.

33 percent in a bond index fund, 33 percent in a U.S. stock index fund, and 33 percent in a non-U.S. stock index fund.

My view that a U.S.-only equity portfolio will serve the needs of most investors was (and still is) challenged by, well, everyone. As the argument goes, “Isn’t omitting non-U.S. stocks from a diversified portfolio just as arbitrary as, say, omitting the technology sector from the S&P

We Americans earn our money in dollars, spend it in dollars, save it in dollars, and invest it in dollars, so why take currency risk? Haven’t U.S. institutions been generally stronger than those of other nations? Don’t half of the revenues and profits of U.S. corporations already come from outside the United States?

A fixed stock/bond ratio? Or a ratio that changes with investor goals, or with time?

One of the reasons for the popularity of target-date funds is their simplicity. All you need to do is estimate what year you plan to retire or your child will start college, and then invest in the fund closest to that target date.

Many TDFs hold actively managed funds as components, whereas others use low-cost index funds.

When determining their asset allocations, most investors need to take Social Security into consideration as a bond-like asset.

While TDFs may ignore Social Security as a bond-like asset, you should not.

Similar plans exist for employees of other types of organizations: the 403(b) plan for nonprofit corporations, the 457 plan for certain nonprofits and state and municipal government employees, and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal government employees.

A rule of thumb suggests that an annual withdrawal rate of 4 percent (including income and capital) of the year-end value of your initial retirement capital, adjusted annually for inflation, is likely—but by no means guaranteed—to be sustainable throughout your retirement years.
