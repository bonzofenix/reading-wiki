
But we can easily lose sight of what is actually meaningful to us, pursuing socially compliant goals and superficial gratifications instead.

we don’t trust ourselves to make good choices,

We cling to our conceptions of ourselves and fear being free to pursue a life direction—perhaps

In the main, our culture doesn’t help people choose their own sense of meaning. Instead, we’re encouraged to define what gives us a sense of worth by chasing superficial wants.

The Values pivot allows us to redirect our yearning for meaning toward the pursuit of the activities that align with what we truly find meaningful. The four flexibility skills you’ve now been developing are of great assistance in making this pivot.

By listening to our pain

we can identify the discrepancies between the way in which we’re living and the way we want to live.

assignment: to notice places he was hurting and to consider the possibility that these places were ones he cared about. He said he’d do it but did not expect much from the exercise.

“What would I have to not care about for this not to hurt?”

In your pain you find your values, and in your avoidance, you find your values disconnection. Without emotional flexibility and openness, it’s impossible to live according to chosen values. By the way, I saw Sam a few months ago for the first time in nearly twenty years. He went on to have a family and to found a business that allowed him to work with scores of children over the years. His two sons, now adults, run his business with him. He is proud of them and happy about their time together. All of that never would have happened had he not used his pain as a flashlight to help him find his values and the direction he really wanted his life to take. Defusion and Self Skills Allow Us to Stop Judging The problem-solving mind loves to sort through reasons that we should or should not do things, which is great when doing your taxes or choosing which stock to pick. But it’s a lousy way to pick values. That’s because coming up with justifications assumes we need some reason

the answer is not really all of the whys

It is far closer to the truth just to say “because I choose to.”

All choices are informed by our history. But justifying our choices with the rationale that they’re what we were taught is a way of avoiding personal responsibility.

We may also get caught up in excessively evaluating whether we’ve chosen the right values, ruminating over whether they’re really our “true values.” With the ability to disregard these unhelpful messages, values work is freeing rather than punishing.

values are not goals but rather are qualities of living—such as living lovingly, playfully, kindly, compassionately, protectively, persistently, and faithfully.

Goals are in the future until they are achieved, and then they’re quickly in the past. Values are always in the now.

A wonderful benefit of values is that at the very moment we identify them, we are already beginning to live them.

values are what you choose to work toward, not what the mind says you have to do or care about, or else.
