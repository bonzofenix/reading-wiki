# THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK OF WORKOUT MOTIVATION

Where you are now is a result of who you were, but where you go from here and ultimately end up depends solely on who you decide to be from this moment forward.

If you have everything under control, you’re not moving fast enough.

## MINDSET

KEY POINTS:

- Decision made today defined where I will be in the future.
  - Define games that are worth playing base of what I want, my values, strength and who I want to be.
- Keep mild control over goals, if everything is under control I am not moving fast enough.
- Sacrify certain for uncertain to get closer to my values, the more I do it will become easier.
  - Face what it is so that it becomes rality to deal with
  - Are we willing to face reality with work or are we pretending?
  - Limitless self control is part of the equation for success, Focus on delayed and uncertain decisions over emotional and instant.

### __WHY__

No matter what you’re facing in life, you have two choices: you can put in the work or get put in your place.

Without a game worth playing, nothing else really matters. Life becomes a daisy chain of random events that happen to us, accidentally rather than intentionally, without rhyme or reason, direction or meaning.

What about you? What game do you most want to play? What do you value most? What are your strengths? Who do you most want to become?

### __SACRIFIES__

it’s hard to __sacrifice the certain for the uncertain__.

sacrificing immediate gratification may be difficult and awkward at first, the more we do it, the easier it becomes.

Every moment of every day, we’re making sacrifices of time, energy, and attention.

People think that finding answers to the right questions is the “secret” to setting and achieving goals. They’re wrong. That’s the easy part. The secret is facing the answers.

Instead of hacks look for __processes__ and __paradigms__

We may say that we want many things in life, if we’re not willing to make the right sacrifices to get them, we’re just __pretending.__

So, you want a beautiful body, you say? That’s nice, but what are you willing to sacrifice for it? Are you willing to hit the gym every day instead of watching TV? Are you willing to stop eating so much of the “wrong” foods you love so much? Are you willing to give every workout everything you’ve got? In other words, do you have the discipline to sacrifice the things you want to do for the things you know you should do? If you can’t answer these questions with bloodless determination, then you don't really want it, and until you can, you'll never get it.Remember: __nothing fails as spectacularly as half measures__.

if we choose to believe that our capacity for self-control is limitless, we’ll be far better at regulating our behavior than if we choose to believe it’s finite.

In order to have the best life possible, you must: know what the best decisions are, and have the courage to make them.

Concrete rewards of “making good bets” may be delayed and uncertain, the emotional ones are always instantaneous and assured. By focusing on the latter, we can gain considerable power over our behavior.

Are we moving past listlessness and cravings for ease and comfort and developing the discipline to focus our minds and efforts on future benefits, or are we still acting like children, succumbing to our shortsighted primitive instincts? Are we making the right bargains with the future, or selling ourselves short?


How much pain are you willing to take? What are you willing to sacrifice?

## SETTING GOALS

KEY POINTS:

- Passion is something you create not something you find.
- Clarify exactly what we want and what are we willing to give up.
  - define what when where I am going to do the task related to my project/goal.
  - Track progress on how far you come or how far is left (focus on the smaller) - reward.
  - Longer span targets are more propense to fail.
- Do not wait for perfect timeing, be insane and desperate around your goals.
- No talking about goal until you can prove objective results.

### __PERFECT TIMING__

“Sometimes death only comes from a lack of energy.”

waiting for perfect is a perfect way to die a little every day.

Hagakure: Common sense will not accomplish great things. Simply become insane and desperate.

“Insane” isn’t enough, according to Lord Naoshige. You have to be desperate too.

### __PURPOSE AND GOALS__

### AMBITIOUS GOALS__

write down your goals, make a plan, make sure the first couple of milestones are easy, anticipate barriers, track your progress, either in terms of how far you’ve come or how much you have left (focus on whichever is smaller), and reward yourself as you make headway.

These are all valid and valuable tactics, but before you do any of that, you first need to reflect on another question: “What kind of pain do I want?”

Aristotle honored this way of life in his elegant formula for success and happiness. “First,” he wrote, “have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end.”

what are you willing to give up?

As Ray Dalio says in Principles, “I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.”

elimination—on clarifying exactly what we want, identifying the prices we’re willing to pay, choosing the most important objectives of the lot, and focusing intently on them.

the longer it takes to bring something into being, the more ways it can falter and fail.

__ACHIVING GOALS__

“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

if you explicitly state what you’re going to do, when you’re going to do it, and where you’re going to do it, you’re much more likely to actually do it.

“Every evening after dinner, I’m going to sit on the balcony and read twenty-five pages before watching TV,” and not “I’m going to read every day.”

Don’t talk about your goals until you can show objective results.

people who don’t announce their goals tend to work harder toward them, and to more realistically assess their progress.

When you’re going to tell someone about what you’re up to, do it in such a way that emphasizes your commitment to the goals, not what you’re aiming for.

You know you’ve got it right when you don’t get praise or approval, but instead a lukewarm “That’s nice.”

You can’t search out passion; you can only create it.

## DOING THE WORK

KEY POINTS:

- Keep all main goals in motion to avoid doubts
- Our primary enemy to puting the work is resistence.
- Focus on being the harder to destroy not the best
- If you don’t like something, do something to change it. Don’t complain; just work harder.
- Happiness tredmill: happiness is persive relatively stable and has a return to the mean behaviour.
  - Good and bad things that happen to us modify our happines for short period of time.
  - If big gains on a resource ocurre apply life changes progresively.
  - If bad things happen is better to do cuts all at once to not prolong the suffering.
  - Focus on minimalism and intentional living.
- Be realistic with a mild bias towards optimism.
- we construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to, not what is.
- Be skepticism and dubiousness when the cost of failure if high, otherwise be optimistic
  - Perform premortem when the cost of failure is high, review and reasses throughout the process

### __RESISTENCE__

How far are you willing to go?

By staying in motion, the roots of doubt and despair can’t take hold and ensuare us. By doing things, we can’t be stopped by thinking things.

“Tell me, I’ll forget; show me, I’ll remember; involve me, I’ll understand.”

If you’re trying to create a healthy, strong, vital body, a business, a career, a relationship, or anything else positive in your life, you’re a warrior, and your primary enemy is Resistance.

If men will not act for themselves, what will they do when the benefit of their effort is for all?

you don’t have to be the best to win. You just have to be harder to destroy.

### __EXCUSES VS PROGRESS__


excuses are tempting. They promise freedom from pain, embarrassment, and failure.

If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.

If you don’t like something, do something to change it. Don’t complain; just work harder.

### __OPTIMISM VS REALITY__

“Facts are better than dreams.”

Cultivate a mindset that is mildly biased toward optimism, not blinded by it.

Hedonic treadmill or hedonic adaptation, which is the tendency to get used to whatever makes us acutely happier.

Having more free time is probably more conducive to your well-being than making more money,

we construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to, not what is.

“Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”

### __STORY TELLING__

The nature of the story you told yourself represents what psychologists would call your “explanatory style,”

Is it really true that this always happens?

How much does this moment really say about the whole?

when good things happen to you, take a moment to celebrate with an optimistic story. What about this win is likely permanent, pervasive, and personal?


### __PRODUCTIVE PESSIMISM__

The fundamental guideline for not deploying optimism is to ask what the cost of failure is in the particular situation. If the cost of failure is high, optimism is the wrong strategy. The pilot in the cockpit deciding whether to de-ice the plane one more time, the partygoer deciding whether to drive home after drinking, the frustrated spouse deciding whether to start an affair that, should it come to light, would break up the marriage should not use optimism. Here the costs of failure are, respectively, death, an auto accident, and a divorce. Using techniques that minimize those costs is inappropriate. On the other hand, if the cost of failure is low, use optimism. In other words, when faced with a tricky situation, ask yourself: “What’s the cost of being wrong here? What’s at stake?” If the potential downsides are significant, then you can save yourself from making crushing mistakes by consciously shifting your mindset toward skepticism and dubiousness, before deploying optimism.

“Optimism is good for staying motivated once you've begun but can be an impediment when analyzing whether you should start in the first place and for planning the endeavor,”

“ premortem is the hypothetical opposite of a postmortem,”

Start by assuming that the undertaking has failed spectacularly. Then, over the next few minutes, write down every reason you can think of for the failure, and pay special attention to the kinds of things you might not want to consider as potential problems due to ego or, if you’re in a group, impoliteness. Then, revisit your plans in light of the pitfalls you’ve uncovered, and generate ideas as to how you can minimize their likelihood of occurring or avoid them altogether. Periodically review your premortem list as you make progress on an endeavor and circumstances change, reflecting on new and different ways to fail and their antidotes.
