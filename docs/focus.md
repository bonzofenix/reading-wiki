# the age of distraction


### It's an addiction:



*   instant positive feedback to such constant activities as checking email
*   Remember! urges are only temporary. Ride it like a wave


### Its a new lifetime:



*   We don't have new strategies for dealing with being connected most of the time
*   we don't have new cultural norms
*   We have not figured out if this is the best way to live life.


### it's an expectation



*   If you wanted to get out you would be going against an entire culture.
*   Being connected all the time, is an expectation that society now has of us.
*   Requires courage, or a willingness to be an arrogant prima donna.
*   **Change expectations so that the system suits us**, not the other way around.


## finding focus

"Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'"



*   Creating is a completely separate process from consuming and communicating.
*   They don't happen at the same time.
*   We can switch between them, but again, we're hurting both processes as we do that.
*    We need to separate the processes


### How to disconnect:

 Unplug. Just unplug your network connector or cable, or turn off your wireless router

Some ideas:



*   Have a disconnect time each day.let people know about these times.
*   Work somewhere without a connection.
*   Get outside. Recharge your batteries, reflect and contemplate.
*   Leave your mobile device behind, or shut it off.
*   Use blocking software.
*   Alternate connection and disconnection. 10/2; 25/5; 45/15
*   Disconnect away from work. A good policy is to leave your work behind, when you're done with work.


### how to beat the connection addiction

breaking the cycle of positive feedback, replace old habit with a new one:



*   **Figure out your triggers**. It's usually something you do each day. **List these out**.
*   **Find a new positive habit** to replace the old habit
*   **Try changing each trigger, one at a time**.
*   Create positive feedback for the new habit.** Engineer your habit change **so that you get almost instant positive feedback.
*   **Create instant negative feedback for the old habit.** Find accountability when you fail to break the bad habit on the trigger.
*   **Repeat** the positive feedback cycle as often as possible for the new habit.


## Focus rituals

You might start each ritual with a couple of cleansing breaths, to bring yourself to the present, to clear your head of thoughts of other things, and to fully focus on the ritual itself.



*   **Morning quiet:  **You start your day in quiet.
*   Start of the day: MITs from inbox. Starting immediately on the top task on this short list of Most Important Tasks.
*   **Refocus ritual: **every hour or two, do a refocus ritual. This only takes a minute or two. You might start it by closing down your browser and maybe other open applications, and maybe even take a walk for a couple of minutes to clear your head and get your blood circulating.
*   **Alternate focus and rest: **This is almost like intervals in exercise -- alternating between periods of hard exercise and rest works well because it allows you to do some pretty intense exercise,
*   **Alternate two focuses: **Instead of alternating between focus and rest, you could alternate between two different focuses. you could work for 10 minutes on one thing and then 10 on another, or stay focused on one as long as you are interested in it
*   **Communicate first, then blocks of focus**: Set a timer and give yourself 45 minutes to do email, Twitter, Facebook IM, and any reading you would normally do.
*   **End of day: **At the end of each day, you might review what you did, think of what can be improved, remind yourself to disconnect for the rest of the evening,
*   **Weekly focus rituals**. GTD weekly review
*   **Just a few other ideas:** taking 5 minutes every hour to refocus yourself; taking a walk every hour to get fresh air and get refreshed; yoga or meditating at the beginning of each day. "focus and disconnected hour" in the morning

Single-task on this important task as long as you can -- ideally until it's done.


# Clear distractions


### why and how to limit the stream

You end up being consumed by what you consume.



*   Starting from scratch. Assume that nothing is sacred, empty your plate, and only put back on it what you absolutely need or love. Let the rest fade away.


### Reducing the stream

Choose what you'll do and read and respond to, and let the rest go.


### an information cleanse

Go on a mini-cleanse. Start with something that's not so scary. Do this once a week.

Things to do:



*   Books
*   Long-form articles or essays you've been wanting to read but haven't had the time for.
*   Do watch informative or thought-provoking films
*

Start with half a day or a day. Gradually expand the time you spend on the cleanse.

Eliminate 1 thing each day:blog, email newsletter,  communication channel, block them using one of the blocking tools.

Place limits on the time you spend reading and communicating. Write these limits down. The smaller the overall limit, the better.


##  let go of the need to stay updated

We might miss out on an opportunity. Possibly. There are always going to be opportunities we miss. But more likely are the opportunities we're missing because we're letting our days be consumed by trying to stay up to date. When we do this, we lose time we could be using to pursue exciting, real opportunities.


### how to break free

test the fears. Do this by tuning out of the news or whatever information you try to keep up with, for one day. Then see if any of your fears came true.


## 4: how not to live in your inbox

"It's not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?" – Henry David Thoreau

Get your task list out of your inbox.

Do email only at pre-appointed times. Just twice a day (say, at 9 am and 3 pm), or once a day at 10 am, or twice a week.

Choose your tasks wisely.


## 5: the value of distraction

Our minds need a break -- being focused for long periods of time is stressful, and we need to alternate focus with periods of relaxation.

Distraction:



*   Our minds working on the problem in the background, in our subconscious.
*   Can lead to inspiration
*   Is fun.
*   Can lead to better focus, once we go back to focusing.

You need to focus on, when your peak focusing hours are, and try different styles to find a method that works best for you.

Work in intervals. Focus for 10-15 minutes, then do 2-5 minutes of distraction, and repeat.

Try a 40-20 split for every hour: 40 minutes of focus, 20 minutes of distraction.

Disconnect completely for large parts of your day,

*   StayFocusd (Chrome)


## creating an uncluttered environment

Just 10-15minute improvements once or twice a day, and slowly you'll be creating a wonderful environment.

Creating the "perfect" environment can become just as much a time-waster and distraction as anything else.



*   **IM:** Only sign in when you're available to chat
*   **Mobile device:** Shut off your cell phone or mobile device, if possible,
*   **Peaceful music** is great because it puts you in the right mood to focus, and it blocks out other sounds.
*   **clear your floor:** If you have a cluttered floor surrounding your workspace, this could take awhile, so do it in chunks. No need to do everything at once.


## 2: slowing down

"There is more to life than increasing its speed." – Gandhi

If our goal is to create, to produce amazing things, to go for quality over quantity, then rushing is not the most effective way to work.



*   Better focus. When you slow down, you can focus better.
*   Deeper focus. Rushing produces shallowness, because you never have time to dig beneath the surface.
*   Better appreciation. You can really appreciate what you have, what you're doing,
*   Enjoyment. When you appreciate things, you enjoy them more.
*   Less stress. Rushing produces anxiety and higher stress levels.

Life as a whole is better if you go slowly, and take the time to savor it, appreciate every moment. That's the simplest reason to slow down.

tips for a slower-paced life



*   Do less. Cut back on your projects, on your task list, on how much you try to do each day.
*   Save smaller, routine tasks for later in the day, but give yourself time to focus.
*   Pick 2-3 important things
*   Practice disconnecting. Have times when you turn off your devices and your email notifications and whatnot.
*   Give yourself time to get ready and get there. If you think it only takes you 10, give yourself 30-45 minutes.
*   Practice being comfortable sitting, doing nothing.
*   Try standing in line and just watching and listening to people around you.
*   Realize that if it doesn't get done, that's OK.
*   There's always tomorrow.
*   Start to eliminate the unnecessary.
*   Practice mindfulness. Simply learn to live in the present,
*   Slowly eliminate commitments -- pick 4-5 essential ones, and realize that the rest, while nice or important, just don't fit right now.


## 3: going with the flow

"Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them – that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like." – Lao-Tzu

no matter how much we try to control our environment, there will be interruptions and distractions. Realize that you can't control everything. you can influence things, but many things are simply out of your control.



*   Become aware.
*   Get perspective.
*   If you get angry over something happening --
*   Let your mind's eye zoom away, until you're far away above your life.
*   Laugh. It helps to see things as funny, rather than frustrating. you can laugh at the situation if you're above it, but not within it. Try laughing even if you don't think it's funny -- it will most likely become funny.
*    Realize that you can't control others. This is one of the biggest challenges. We get frustrated with other people, because they don't act the way we want them to act. Maybe it's our kids, maybe it's our spouse or significant other, maybe it's our coworker or boss, maybe it's our mom or best friend.
*   Practice.

Accept that the world is constantly changing, and we are a part of that change.

Enjoy life as a flow of change, chaos and beauty.

try seeing the world as perfect the way it is. It's messy, chaotic, painful, sad, dirty... and completely perfect.

"We must learn to position ourselves effortlessly within each moment, rather than stumbling through time. We can either escape from the moment or stay with it as it unfolds and do something good with it." And this is exactly right.

"We must learn to position ourselves effortlessly within each moment, rather than stumbling through time. We can either escape from the moment or stay with it as it unfolds and do something good with it."

See the situation with some objectivity, instead of fleeing from it blindly. Carefully consider your options -- all of them.

And then respond to the situation mindfully and with the appropriate response --

three strategies for prioritizing tasks

when trying to find focus is having too many tasks competing for their time.

One of the biggest problems people have when trying to find focus is having too many tasks competing for their time.

too many tasks tough to prioritize

tasks compete for your time

reduce your tasks

pick the 3-5 most important tasks.

small tasks will go on a "do later"

A good way to deal with the smaller, routine tasks that must be done (check email, pay bills, fill out paperwork, and so on)

to schedule a block of time later in the day to deal with them -- perhaps

the last 30 minutes of your day,

Early in the day, focus on the important tasks.

choose the task that excites you

How do you pick? Choose the task that most excites you, that feels compelling, that you're most passionate about.

If you have several tasks you're excited about, you might also consider which task will have the biggest effect on your life.

single-task

Clear away all distractions, including your mobile device and the Internet.

Just have the application open that you need to work on that task.

letting go of goals

Until recently, I'd always set goals

goals are not ideal,

They are artificial -- you aren't working because you love it, you're working because you've set goals.

They're constraining -- what if you want to work on something not in line with your goals?

They put pressure on us to achieve, to get certain things done. Pressure is stressful, and not always in a good way. When we fail (and we always do), it's discouraging. We're always thinking about the future (goals) instead of the present. I prefer to live in the present. But most of all, here's the thing with goals: you're never satisfied. Goals are a way of saying, "When I've accomplished this goal (or all these goals), I will be happy then. I'm not happy now, because I haven't achieved my goals." This is never said out loud, but it's what goals really mean. The problem is, when we achieve the goals, we don't achieve happiness.

We should do what makes us happy, follow our passions, do things that make us excited.

what I do, instead of setting and achieving goals:

I do what excites me. Each day.

I don't worry about where I'll be (professionally) in a year or even six months, but where I am right now.

don't make plans, because they're an illusion

learned to go with the flow, to not worry about things that disrupt plans but worry about what to do right now.

don't force things, but do what comes naturally.

focus on the present, on being happy now.

It's a beautiful way of working. And not incidentally, I've accomplished even more this way, without making that a goal.

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

A simple life is less stressful, more sane, happier.

finding simplicity

I've rid my life of things I didn't like doing.

simpler life means fewer commitments. This is difficult, as commitments accumulate over the years just as much as possessions do, and the result is that we have no time in our lives for what really matters.

Focusing less on busy-work and more on important work that has a high impact on your career and business.

Working on fewer projects and tasks so you're less busy, and more focused.

Eliminating streams of communication, news, distractions.

A simplified work life can be difficult for a couple of reasons, though:

You have to learn to say "no" to others. By saying "yes" to every request from others, you allow all your time to be taken up by tasks that are important to others, not necessarily to you.

You should also try to learn to do less. This is difficult for most people, because we're taught that doing more means we're more productive, and if we look busy, people will think we're productive and important.

Doing important work is what true productivity is all about,

Pick your life's short list.

Big picture stuff: what do you love most?

my list was: spending time with family, writing, reading and running. Pick just 4-5 things, even if there are lots of other things that also seem important.

Now make a longer list: what else is in your life that's not on the short list?

next step is to start eliminating commitments that aren't on the short list.

Do the same for your work life -- what's most important, and what doesn't make your short list of most important projects and goals?

Start clearing clutter in one spot. Physical clutter can be overwhelming, which is why you should just pick one small spot, and clear that.

making three smaller piles: stuff you use and love, stuff you can donate, and trash.

how to systematically simplify

Take 10 minutes a day to simplify your commitments,

If you choose to simplify what you do, cross things off your to-do list that aren't on your short list

a simple system for getting amazing things done

find something amazing to work on

Every day, first thing in the morning, figure out Something Amazing that you want to work on today.

It can be anything:

It should compel you to work on it because you're inspired, excited, motivated.

step 2: clear away everything else

clearing away distractions.

You're going to clear your desk

You're going to clear your computer

turn off all notifications on your computer that might distract you:

turn off your phone,

clear away meetings and anything on your task list that will interfere with this one task.

focus on that Something Amazing

before you go into work

as soon as you get into work

take a deep breath, and remember why you chose this task.

Do your best to either finish this Something Amazing, or a good chunk of it.

finish a chunk that'll take at least an hour or two of your day.

Keep doing this, working on exciting and amazing things, for the rest of your life.

single-tasking and productivity

Our brains can really only handle one thing at a time, and so we get so used to switching between one thing and another with our brains that we program them to have a short attention span. This is why it's so hard to learn to focus on one thing at a time again. a single-tasking life Imagine instead, a single-tasking life. Imagine waking and going for a run, as if running were all you do. Nothing else is on your mind but the run, and you do it to the very best of your abilities. Then you eat, enjoying every flavorful bite of your fresh breakfast of whole, unprocessed foods. You read a novel, as if nothing else in the world existed. You do your work, one task at a time, each task done with full focus and dedication.

how to live a single-tasking life

Become conscious.

Clear distractions.

As you do it, become aware of really doing it, and of the urge to switch to something else. Paying attention is the important first step.

Choose wisely.

Don't just start doing something. Give it some thought -- do you really want to turn on the TV?

Really pour yourself into it.

complete focus, complete dedication.

Practice.

start right now, but you're not likely to be good at it at first. Keep at it. Practice daily, throughout the day.

single-tasking productivity

Pick just a few tasks each day.

each day you should make a short list -- just 1-3 things

(MIT) list.

Don't do anything else before doing the first thing on your short list of MITs.

Clear distractions.

Shut off phones, close the browser if possible,

disconnect your Internet if you can stand it.

One task at a time.

Focus on one task until it's done, then move to the next.

If you feel the urge to check your email or switch to another task, stop yourself. Breathe deeply. Re-focus yourself. Get back to the task at hand.

Keep on your MITs until you're done. Then you have time for email, paperwork, routine tasks,

Or if you have the time, pick another set of MITs.

If other things come up, note them on a piece of paper or small notebook.

Take deep breaths, stretch, and take breaks now and then.

Keep a very short to-do list, clear distractions, do one thing at a time, until the list is finished. That's single-tasking productivity at its essence.

doing multiple projects at once is sometimes more effective than only one project at once.

multi-projecting can work -- you get one project going, but while you're waiting on something, you can switch to a second or even third project.

taking on as few projects as possible.

If you can do only one project at a time, without getting stuck in waiting, then do that

4: focused reading and research

how to do the research necessary for focused creation

Close email/IM/social networks and other distractions.

Do your initial search, and open up your initial batch of articles/ pages.

Skim these articles/pages, looking for links to other articles you might need to read. Open those links.

Repeat with the new articles, skimming and opening links as necessary. Do this until you have all the articles open you need to read.

Read one article at a time, using the method in the previous section -- opening that article in its own window and hiding everything else.

Read through the article, and take any notes necessary. Bookmark the article if necessary for later reference.

Repeat, taking notes and bookmarking one article at a time. When your research is done, you can do the actual work, using the focus techniques for work in the other chapters of this book. 5:

Recently a fellow blogger wrote to me talking about how many pounds she lost on vacation because she walked all day long -- something many of us have experienced. She ended by saying, "If only I could find the time to walk 6 hours a day." That got me to ask -- why not?

walking, disconnection & focus

if you:

have any control over your schedule;

can work from different locations;

want to get more active and trim your waistline;

need to find new ways to focus and get important things done.

Walk for 20-30 minutes to a location: coffee shop, library, park, beach, cafe or bistro, peaceful rest spot, etc. Don't use mobile devices as you walk – remain disconnected.

Work or read for 30-40 minutes: write, take notes, read, respond to emails, design, meet with a colleague or client, make calls, whatever. You can also have coffee, some water, fruits, a small meal, and so on.

Repeat as many times as you can.

bit of a nomadic work schedule, roaming from one place to another, but it has numerous benefits: When you walk, you can think, which is something that's hard to do when you're sitting and distracted all day.

When you get to your destination, write down all the notes from your walking contemplation.

When you walk, you can also clear your head, meditate, or just enjoy your surroundings and relieve stress.

You get into tremendous shape by walking so much.

Your work will also be more focused, because you have less time to work. Use the 30-40 minute bursts of work for important tasks that you think about as you walk.

Some stops can be in spots without a wireless connection, which means you'll get more work done without the distraction of the Internet.

the disconnect and connect working routine

Consider a routine such as the following:

Disconnect for a day (or two). No Internet connection -- perhaps no computer at all if using your computer is too much of a temptation to connect. Use an actual paper notepad and pen, writing and brainstorming and making pages of notes or sketches. Make phone calls instead of connecting via email or IM.

Then connect for a day (or two). Take all the notes and work you did during your disconnect, and type them up and email them and post them online and so forth.

Repeat. You can vary the number of days you're disconnected or connected, finding the balance that works for you.

conclusions

The purpose of these two routines isn't to tell you how to work, because we must each find the style and routine that works for our particular job.

You don't need to do these things exactly the way I've outlined above, but you can find a blend that works best for you.

uses both concepts, or a once-a-week walking or disconnect period.

creativity and practicing deep focus

creativity killers

Distractions.

we fragment our focus, we fragment creation itself.

Intimidation.

If we think we're not good at it, we become intimidated as well and often won't even start.

Pressure.

Try creating when someone is watching over your shoulder -- your mind has a hard time focusing,

the less pressure, the better, because it allows us to relax and focus.

Lack of use.

When we don't create on a regular basis, it becomes intimidating.

the most important creativity habit

solitude. Creativity flourishes in solitude.

benefits I've found from solitude: time for thought in being alone, we get to know ourselves we face our demons, and deal with them space to create space to unwind, and find peace time to reflect on what we've done, and learn from it isolation from the influences of other helps us to find our own voice quiet helps us to appreciate the smaller things that get lost in the roar If you want to nurture creativity, you need to create the proper environment for it: an environment of solitude, free of distractions, full of quiet and a blank canvas.

isolation from the influences of other helps us to find our own voice

If you want to nurture creativity, you need to create the proper environment for it: an environment of solitude, free of distractions, full of quiet and a blank canvas.

Pablo Picasso: "Without great solitude no serious work is possible."

other important habits

Deep focus.

losing yourself in the task, so that you forget the world around you

Small tasks. If intimidation stops us from creating, we need to make things less intimidating, less overwhelming.

Do the task, take a quick break, and focus on the next small task.

Constant practice.

Set aside time for creating each day,

Enjoyment. If you enjoy the creating, it becomes something you look forward to.

Relaxation. If you start to feel pressure, start to become tense, practice relaxation methods:

do a short meditation where you focus on your breath coming in and going out, for a minute.

a nice cup of tea also helps -- enjoy the tea in silence, without working, and after 5-10 minutes

Inspiration. While it might seem contradictory, you need to connect with others sometimes in order to find inspiration. That might just mean reading, watching, or listening to others' work,

finding a balance between connecting and solitude --

split your day into times for connecting and inspiration, and a time for solitude and creating.

Shake things up. When things begin to stagnate, get out of your routine. Try new things.

finding stillness and reflection

pause

Take a minute out of your busy day to do this little exercise: pause in the middle of all you have to do, all that's going on around you.

Close your eyes, and sit still.

The intent of fear is to protect us, and it accomplishes this by dreaming up every potential negative outcome, then repeating them over and over in our minds.

ignoring fear doesn't work.

Exploring fear is one of the kindest things you can do for yourself.

The first step to coping with fear is to establish a plan. The purpose of the plan is for you to feel prepared when you are trying to focus, but fear intervenes.

When you feel the urge to distract but you really want to focus, they will be available. prepare

Here are five guidelines for getting acquainted with your fear.
